\arguments{
\item{intercept}{Prior specification for intercepts}

\item{coefficient}{Prior specfication for slope coefficients}

\item{sd}{Prior specification for random effects SDs}

\description{
Generates a list of custom specifications of priors for parameters in the model.
It is possible to set priors for a category of parameters (e.g. intercept,
coefficient, sd, factor, continuous) or to set a prior for a specific
parameter name (optionally including brackets with indices).
Exact name matches including brackets/indices are used first, followed by
name matches without indices, followed by data type (factor/continuous)
followed by parameter type (intercept/coefficient/sd).
Arguments can be supplied as quoted code or as character strings.
